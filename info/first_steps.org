  Please type `M-x apdl' which opens a buffer in APDL-Mode and you can
  inspect the menu bar's `APDL' and `MAPDL' entries.  For existing
  APDL files please type `M-x apdl-mode' if the mode is not activated
  already, please see the following Configuration section for the
  pre-configured file suffixes.

  For further guidance please select the APDL menu `APDL-Mode
  Documentation' (or type `C-c C-h') and `Describe APDL-Mode' (or type
  `C-h m') for the list of its keybindings.  You might also check the
  introductory APDL-Mode [[file:doc/A-M_introductory_tutorial.org][tutorial]].

  APDL-Mode is tested with Ansys v193 and v201 under Windows 10, as
  well as under Emacs-25 and 26 under GNU-Linux and Windows.
