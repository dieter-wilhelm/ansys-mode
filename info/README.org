* Introduction
  #+include:../info/introduction.org

  [[file:doc/connect_command_snippet_to_file.png]]

* Some Highlights
** In-built APDL command help with argument counter
   Especially for commands with a large number of arguments it is
   cumbersome to count the arguments, *C-?* facilitates this for you
   and visualises dynamically at which parameter position your cursor
   currently is.

   [[file:doc/parameter_help2.png]]

** Pin-pointing the relevant Ansys documentation
   You can trigger (*C-c C-b*) the relevant Ansys manual entry
   directly from your APDL-Mode session without the detour of
   searching in the Ansys online help (default since V19).  This works
   not only for APDL commands but also element names and other manual
   topics. (To that end you must have started / registered the Ansys
   online help once from an Ansys product.  But I recommend installing
   the Ansys documentation locally, loading is much faster.)

   The image below is showing a manual entry in GNU-Emacs' EWW
   browser. You are able to consult the manual side-by-side with your
   APDL code.

** Code outlining for inspecting WorkBench solver (.dat) files
   APDL-Mode hides the normally uninteresting but usually very large
   number blocks.

   The image below shows the unhidden content.

** Command Snippet Templates and Code Highlighting Example
   The image shows GNU-Emacs with a ripped off APDL-Mode menu field,
   the APDL variable buffer, the APDL file itself and an APDL template
   preview.  You are able to compile your most often used WorkBench /
   Discovery AIM Command snippets and have them all immediately
   available for inspection and inclusion.

* Installation
  #+include: ./INSTALLATION.org

* First Steps
  #+include: ./first_steps.org
* Configuration and Customisation
  Most functionality of APDL-Mode is working without additional
  configurations.  APDL-Mode is intelligent enough to figure out Ansys
  installation dependent paths.  For regular Ansys installations, it
  chooses by default the highest installed Ansys version on your
  system.

  APDL-Mode configures GNU-Emacs to open all files with the suffixes
  ".mac", ".dat" and ".inp" under apdl-mode.

  Please read [[file:info/apdl-config.org][apdl-config]] documentation, or the accompanying
  configuration [[file:info/apdl-config.el][example-file]] for further details.
* Bugs and Problems
  #+include: ./bugs.org
* News
  APDL-Mode's completions- and help system is updated to Ansys 2020R1.

  For further news please have a look into the [[file:info/NEWS.org][NEWS]] file.
* Further Resources
  If you want to read further details regarding the APDL scripting,
  GNU-Emacs and other APDL editors please read the [[file:info/resources.org][RESOURCES]] file.
