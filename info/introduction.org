APDL ([[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSYS_Parametric_Design_Language][Ansys Parametric Design Language]]) is the solver scripting
language of the mechanical FEA (Finite Element Analysis) suite [[http://www.ansys.com][Ansys]]
(ANalysis SYStem, registered TM).

APDL-Mode (formerly Ansys-Mode) is - in conjunction with the
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU-Emacs]] editor - an advanced APDL environment with features like,
pin-pointing the APDL reference documentation, keyword completion,
code templates, dedicated highlighting, solver communication
(GNU-Linux only), license reporting, etc.  Over the years it has
accumulated lots of features for writing and debugging FEA complete
models in APDL code. Please convince yourself with the APDL-Mode
in-depth documentation.

With the advent of the modern Ansys GUIs - like `WorkBench' or
`Discovery AIM' - the usage of APDL as a wholesale modelling
language has diminished for non automated tasks.  But APDL is here
to stay: `WorkBench' and `AIM' operate exclusively the Ansys solver
with it!  They are producing and sending APDL input (.dat) files to
the solver.  For a true understanding of the GUIs' inner workings a
study of their APDL code is prerequisite!  Moreover, the GUIs are
not supporting all solver features.  So "Command (APDL)" objects
are used to enhance the GUIs' modelling capabilities.

Nowadays I find APDL-Mode mostly useful for studying solver (.dat)
files which were created by WorkBench.  And, especially, for writing
WorkBench `Command' objects and inspecting longer command snippets
from other sources.  Accessing the Ansys APDL reference documentation
with the detour of searching the keywords alone is worth using
APDL-Mode!

When you "Export" (or "Import") such a WorkBench "Command (APDL)"
object it becomes associated with a file and is then editable with a
third party editor.  When you have modified the file then the "File
Status" in Workbench changes and you can pull-in the updated content
with the "Refresh" button.
